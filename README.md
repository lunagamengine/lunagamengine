# 🌙 Luna Game Engine

![Luna Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1906b717-fff7-4c42-94a6-fdc326cd5c2f)

**Luna** is a modern, cross-platform 2D game engine written in **C++**, featuring support for multiple rendering backends including **Vulkan**, **OpenGL**, and **Direct3D11**. Designed for performance and flexibility, Luna comes with a built-in editor that empowers developers to create, visualize, and iterate on game content in real-time.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔷 **Multi-API Rendering**: Abstract rendering system with support for Vulkan, OpenGL, and Direct3D11.
- 🎮 **2D Game Focused**: Optimized specifically for 2D games, with efficient sprite batching, tilemaps, and animation support.
- 🛠️ **Built-in Editor**: Luna includes a powerful and extensible editor for scene management, entity editing, and live previews.
- 🔌 **Modular Architecture**: Clean, modular codebase designed for easy extension and integration.
- 🚀 **High Performance**: Low-level optimizations with modern C++ practices and hardware-accelerated rendering.
- 🧱 **Entity-Component System (ECS)**: Robust ECS design to manage complex scenes with thousands of entities.
- 📁 **Asset Management**: Integrated pipeline for managing textures, sounds, and other game assets.
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform**: Core engine supports Windows and other platforms (Linux/macOS) with minimal modification.

## 🖥️ The Editor

The Luna Editor is a core part of the development workflow, enabling developers to:

- Create and manage game scenes
- Add, remove, and modify components for each entity
- Preview the game in real time within the editor
- Drag-and-drop assets directly into scenes
- Save and load scenes as JSON or binary formats

The editor is built using native C++ and integrates seamlessly with the underlying engine architecture.
